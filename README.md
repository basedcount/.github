# Based Count
Based Count is an international team of developers who specialize in creating community building experiences. 

## Our Projects
### 1. Based Count Bot
Working with [r/PoliticalCompassMemes](https://old.reddit.com/politicalcompassmemes) (PCM), we’ve designed a ranked leaderboard based on how users engage with each other and the community. Based Count Bot has become an integral part of this community’s culture, and rewards positive and collaborative communication without boxing in the culture of this unique subreddit. 

### 2. Minerva
Minerva is a data scraper and organizer monitoring all interactions on [r/PoliticalCompassMemes](https://old.reddit.com/politicalcompassmemes). We use her to build our other projects, but she’s capable of so much more. We’ve developed a proprietary methodology for storing and ranking forum interactions all while keeping data access speeds high and storage needs low. 

### 3. BasedCount.com
Can you tell we like our name? [Based Count](https://basedcount.com) is our user facing portal where people can track their community interactions, points (pills) and see what rewards they’ve been given by other members of the community. Written with Go and Svelte, the site is fast, responsive, and low-cost, making it an integral part of our strategy to foster healthy independent communities. 

### Flair Change Bot
Flair Change Bot tracks and catalogues Reddit flair changes for PCM. Flair Count Bot is a key part of our strategy to build a community where our users are.

## Our Philosophy 
We believe in building communities around where they naturally form. We understand that no two committees are the same, and that one size fits all solutions fit no one. A big reason why we’ve started building our tools for PCM is the difficulty of tailoring for so many diverse mindsets. If we can succeed at bringing these people together we can succeed at building a better, more honest, and friendlier world.
